# 🚀 Terminal Adventure: The Key of SAAT-NUAST

**A narrative-driven terminal RPG set in a fractured galaxy ruled by ancient houses, hidden history, and prophecy.**

In the year **4052**, the **Luken Empire** governs the stars through four powerful houses — and one that was erased from history. A mysterious prophecy leads to **SAAT-NUAST**, an ancient ruin floating between worlds, holding a **Key of Infinite Knowledge**.

You are one of the chosen.  
Or one of the forgotten.  
Your journey shapes the fate of this universe.
